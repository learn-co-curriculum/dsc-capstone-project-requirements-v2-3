# Capstone Project Description

One last project to go before graduation!

In this project description, we will cover:

* Project Overview
* Deliverables
* Grading
* Getting Started

## Project Overview

For the Capstone project, you will engage in one more **supervised machine learning** process from start to finish. The choice of topic, dataset, target, and type of model is yours.

### Business Problem and Data

You are responsible for identifying an appropriate business problem and dataset. You need to be able to complete all elements of the checklist, which means that **you must utilize supervised machine learning**. Other components like unsupervised learning and data dashboards may be part of the overall process but are not sufficient to pass this project.

In other words, you need to find a business problem where you can frame the question as:

> Using `features`, can we predict `target`? This would be useful because `rationale`.

Let's break that question down further:

1. **Features:** What are the *inputs* to your model? Think about the contexts where this information would be available
2. **Target:** What is your model trying to *predict*? Is this something that would realistically be unknown in a context where the above features are known?
3. **Rationale:** Why would it be valuable to be able to predict this target? Who would find this model useful? How accurate does the model need to be in order to serve the stated purpose?

Other questions like "what is the relationship between `a` and `b`" or "how much does `c` factor into `d` outcomes" may be incidentally possible, but make sure you have that predictive framing first.

### Key Points

#### Project Management

Project management is key. You have a lot of freedom in this project - this can feel liberating, but also means that you can accidentally lose a lot of time if you're not careful. Map out a rough daily project plan with key milestones and due dates for deliverables - you can adjust this as needed as you progress. Use this to make sure you're making timely progress towards successful completion. Ask for help if you find yourself struggling to keep up with your plan.

#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

It's understandable that you want this project to represent the best of your abilities. But we also want you to graduate on time! Sometimes this means that you need to have a "done is better than perfect" mindset, to make sure that you complete all of the baseline requirements. For your MVP, just try to make sure you have completed all checklist elements and have achieved the "Meets Objective" standard for each rubric objective. You will have plenty of time afterwards to add bells and whistles (including during your job search!), so try to stay focused on the MVP for now.

## Deliverables

At this point, the project deliverables should be familiar:

* A **non-technical presentation**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **GitHub repository**

The checklist of requirements is the same as it was in Phase 3 and Phase 3.

### Non-Technical Presentation

Get used to saying ***"I am a data scientist"***! When introducing yourself in your Capstone presentation, be sure to say

> I am a data scientist with a background in...

You are a data scientist!

### Jupyter Notebook

Feel free to make multiple notebook as you explore data and models. Just make sure that there is one final notebook that is clearly designated as such.
